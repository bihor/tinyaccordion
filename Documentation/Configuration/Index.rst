Configuration
-------------

You can configure this extension to use tt\_content, pages + tt\_content, news or Calamiga-elements as
database table. You should think about how the result should looks
like. If you need a result like in “Example 1” (flat hierarchy), you
must use tt\_content else you must use pages, news or Camaliga elements. See chapter Reference
below for the whole TypoScript configuration.
